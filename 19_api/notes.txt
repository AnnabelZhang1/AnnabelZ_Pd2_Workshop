K19 -- A RESTful Journey Skyward

HTTP Request
- JSON is stored as a dictionary, which allows for easy access to the dictionary's
information via keys
- Very nice picture
- Looks easy to parse in a program
- Dev Console has some style

App
- There's urllib, urllib2, and urllib3; urllib and urllib2 are in CPython's
standard library, while urllib3 is not. The difference between urllib and urllib2
is that urllib2 is an updated version "that can be extended by defining
custom protocol handlers"
- json lib is nice
